## Navigating The Changing Landscape of Information  Security: A Risk Management Approach for Financial Institutions

This project focuses on critical aspects of Information Security Management, including risk assessment, security audits, and fostering a security culture within organizations. By assessing the current security landscape and implementing technical controls, the project aims to mitigate threats and enhance organizational resilience. The work also emphasizes transferable skills such as risk analysis, strategic planning, and decision-making, aligning with real-world industry and research applications.

##### LO1: Review Information Security Landscape and Discuss Its Implications
Analyzed the evolving information security landscape, examining emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and their impact on organizations. Evaluated real-world case studies to understand the broader implications of cybersecurity trends.

##### LO2: Perform Risk Management and Audits
Conducted comprehensive risk assessments to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. Implemented auditing frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.

##### LO3: Implement Security Culture in an Organization
Developed strategies to foster a security-first mindset within organizations. Designed training programs and communication plans to promote awareness and adherence to security policies across all levels of the organization.

##### LO4: Assess and Recommend Technical Security Controls
Evaluated technical security controls to mitigate common attack techniques such as phishing, malware, and DDoS attacks. Recommended solutions tailored to organizational needs, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint protection.

##### LO5: Apply Transferable Skills and Attributes
Demonstrated problem-solving, analytical thinking, and communication skills through risk analysis, audit reporting, and the development of security frameworks. These skills are applicable to both industry and research environments.
